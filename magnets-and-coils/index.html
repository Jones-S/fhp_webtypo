                <p class="intro-text__paragraph bold">&ldquo;Magnets and Coils&rdquo; is marble run game, where two players can compete against each other. Short reaction times and well targeted anticipation help to win this game where the aim is to hit a button as swift as possible after the magnetic marble passes one of the copper coils&nbsp;along&nbsp;he&nbsp;run.</p>

        <div class="sector-text">
            <p class="sector-text__paragraph">In a physcial computing module in <strong>Interaction Design</strong> at the <strong>ZHdK</strong> we had to come up with a concept to embrace the topic <strong>&ldquo;energy harvesting&rdquo;</strong>.
With the premise to use gamification and the knowledge that we can induce current with the use of magnets and copper coils, we decided to build a marble run with a magnetic ball, which passes through copper coils every&nbsp;now&nbsp;and&nbsp;then.</p>

        <div class="sector-text">
            <p class="sector-text__paragraph">That&rsquo;s how we could register the exact point of time when the ball passed each coil. The game would challenge the players to press a button as fast as the can just after the ball has passed a coil. The quicker reaction wins a point. Anticipation is as important as reaction time – although it is to mention that if a player pressed too early, he did not get the point but instead got blocked for the next coil.
            Points and errors due to early pressing were indicated with status LEDs in front of the players. After seven coils the game was decided and the player with more points went off as&nbsp;a&nbsp;winner.</p>

            <div class="text-by-illu">
                <p class="text-by-illu__paragraph">Additionally we used a similar concept to make the <strong>input device</strong> (handle with a button) work. Both handles also were constructs made of copper coils and big magnetic balls. By shaking the handle every player could induce current which was saved in a <strong>capacitor</strong>. By pressing the button a little bit of this current was released and registered by the <strong>arduino microcontroller</strong> taking care of processing all the&nbsp;different&nbsp;input.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="sector-text">
            <p class="sector-text__paragraph">So each player has to charge his input device first and release some current at the exact right moment.
            It is crucial that one does not release too much current at once.</p>
